# go-vegan
This project originated from my specialization in User Experience Design (UX) at the California Institute of Arts, completed through the Coursera platform. Initially developed as a UI Design project, GoVegan was created to explore innovative solutions that simplify food delivery for a fictional vegan restaurant.
