# GoVegan

This project originated from my specialization in User Experience Design (UX) at the California Institute of Arts, completed through the Coursera platform. Initially developed as a UI Design project, GoVegan was created to explore innovative solutions that simplify food delivery for a fictional vegan restaurant. Using solid UX principles and extensive research, I aimed to design an intuitive and engaging user experience. Now, I am bringing this design to life in code, with the goal of testing it with users to validate the effectiveness of the solution.
